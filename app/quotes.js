export const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is it okay to feel numb sometimes?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Emotional numbness is often your mind's way of protecting you from overwhelm. It's temporary and doesn't mean you're broken. The fact that you're aware of it and want to reconnect with your emotions shows you're already on the path to healing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I struggle to care even when I want to?",
    answer:
      "This is more common than you think, especially when dealing with brain fog or emotional exhaustion. Caring is an emotional skill that can be depleted when you're running on empty. Focus on taking care of your basic needs first - sleep, nutrition, hydration, and mental clarity. As you feel better physically and mentally, your capacity for caring will return.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I grow even after losing someone important?",
    answer:
      "Loss is painful, but it can also be a powerful teacher. The relationship showed you what you value and where you want to grow. Use this time to build the emotional skills you wish you'd had. Every day you work on yourself is honoring both your growth and what that relationship meant to you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I mess up again in my next relationship?",
    answer:
      "Making mistakes is part of being human and learning. The difference now is that you're aware of your patterns and actively working to change them. That self-awareness is huge. You won't be perfect, but you'll be more emotionally intelligent and better equipped to handle challenges.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to feel 'normal' again?",
    answer:
      "There's no timeline for emotional healing, and 'normal' might look different than before - and that's okay. Focus on progress, not perfection. Some days will be better than others. What matters is that you're committed to the process and being patient with yourself.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I can't maintain these new habits?",
    answer:
      "Start small and be realistic. You don't need to do everything perfectly every day. Pick one or two practices that feel manageable and build from there. It's better to do a little consistently than to burn out trying to do everything at once.",
